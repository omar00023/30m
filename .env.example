# ATTENTION: Environment variables are no longer used!

This project no longer uses environment variables (.env file).

Instead, all configuration is centralized in config.ts.

Please edit the config.ts file directly to change any configuration values.

Key settings you will need to modify:
- Bot token
- Client ID 
- MongoDB URI
- Main Guild ID
- Dashboard configuration

For more detailed instructions, see README-CONFIG.md.
